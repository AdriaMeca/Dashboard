## Dashboard

In this repository you can find all the code used to build the Dashboard of the project "Gender violence, a dark shadow of the pandemic" as well as extra material that doesn't appear in the final Streamlit version.

In the documents named "gender_violence_name.ipynb" you can find the code developed by each contributor: Adrià's file studies the correlation between the number of calls and the real cases; Clara's file contains pie charts and histograms of the different phone call characteristics; in Guillem's file there are several charts that adress the relation between different types of violence; and Lior's file has a detailed analysis of the geographical properties of the data.

The file "dashboard.py" merges all this content together in the form of a Streamlit application.
